Jean Baudrilland writes
If hysteria was the pathology of the exacerbated staging of the subject,
a pathology of expression, of the body's theatrical and operatic conver-
sion; and if paranoia was the pathology of organization, of the struc-
turation of a rigid and jealous world; then with communication and
information, with the immanent promiscuity of these networks, with
their continual connections, we are now in a new form of schizophre-
nia. (133)</mixed-citation>

O'Donnell resist such a formulation, arguing that the op-
position is insufficient, since the paranoid also "relies on the segmentation that
characterizes the schizoid regime" (28)</mixed-citation>
