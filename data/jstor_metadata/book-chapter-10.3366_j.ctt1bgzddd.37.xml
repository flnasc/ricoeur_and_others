                     <p>The medical humanities are at a critical juncture. On the one hand, practitioners of this field can bask in their recent successes: in the UK, at least, what was once a loose set of intuitions – broadly about animating the clinical and research spaces of biomedicine with concepts and methods from the humanities – has become a visible and coherent set of the interventions, with its own journals, conferences, centres, funding streams and students.¹ On the other hand, the growth, coherence and stratifi cation of this heterogeneous domain have raised the spectre of just what, exactly, the medical humanities is growing<italic>into</italic>.²</p>

Drawing towards the end of his presentation, an experienced pharmacologist admonishes the audience to bear in mind that, despite the progress in modelling techniques that he has been discussing, a model is always just a representation and never reality. At this point, there is a PowerPoint slide showing Magritte’s painting,<italic>This is not a Pipe</italic>, and chuckling from the audience. It will not have been the first time that they have</p>

                     <p>This chapter explores the articulations that have emerged over the last half-century between various types of holism, Chinese medicine and systems biology. Given the discipline’s historical attachments to a definition of ‘medicine’ that rather narrowly refers to biomedicine as developed in Europe and the US from the eighteenth century onwards, the medical humanities are not the most obvious starting point for such an inquiry. At the same time, they do offer one advantage over neighbouring disciplines like a medical history, anthropology or science and technology studies for someone like myself, a clinician as well as a historian and anthropologist: their</p>

                     <p>From a medical perspective, the genome can today be used primarily as a source of health information for diagnoses and prospective disease risk management. Gene therapy may be an option in the future. For scientists, the genome is the sum of an organism’s DNA molecules, which can be sequenced and used to explain heredity and development. What is a genome for those who have it in their bodies and who<italic>live</italic>it? How do they make sense of it? What meanings are associated with the genome in their lifeworlds, where identities are formed and decisions taken in personal, family and</p>

                     <p>Stephen Jay Gould, the biologist and author of<italic>The Mismeasure of Man</italic>, once joked that were he an identical twin raised separately from his brother they could ‘hire ourselves out to a host of social scientists and practically name our fee’.¹ In order to monetise Gould’s fantasy, one would want a form of twinship that could operate according to evidential, experimental, somatic and circumstantial ideals. And Gould admits that he and his brother would need to be viewed as ‘the only really adequate natural experiment for separating genetic from environmental effects in humans’.² With respect to Gould’s light-hearted intentions, this</p>

                     <p>As the digital revolution takes hold, historians have begun to reflect on the ways in which paper technologies – the codex, notebook, printed book and their indexes, annotations and tools of ordering – have come into being and contributed to the production of knowledge. Objects that were once considered evidence for historical inquiry have become their subjects.¹ The same reflexivity applies to notions of evidence, observation and objectivity, often labelled as facts and data, which have themselves been historically studied.² This chapter is about what happens when historians use digital technologies to understand paper technologies. It draws on my work to digitise</p>

                     <p>Over the last twenty years or so, fatness,¹ pathologised as overweight and obesity, has been a core public health concern around which has grown a lucrative international weight loss industry. Referred to as a ‘time bomb’ and ‘the terror within’, analogies of ‘war’ circulate around obesity, framing fatness as enemy.² Religious imagery and cultural and moral ideologies inform medical, popular and policy language with the ‘sins’ of ‘gluttony’ and ‘sloth’, evoked to frame fat people as immoral at worst and unknowledgeable victims at best,³ and understandings of fatness intersect with gender, class, age, sexuality, disability and race to make some</p>

On the newspaper’s website, an image of a black-andwhite brain scan overlaid with handcuffs headed the essay. Clicking ‘play’ turned the image into a video filled with three-dimensional brain illustrations and Raine’s claims that some brains are simply more biologically prone to violence than others. Rejecting what he describes as ‘the dominant model for understanding criminal behaviour in the twentieth century’ – a model based ‘almost exclusively on social and sociological’ explanations 1</p>

                     <p>Changing ideas on the nature of and relationship between the senses in nineteenth-century Europe constructed blindness as a disability in often complex ways. The loss or absence of sight was disabling in this period, given vision’s celebrated status, and visually impaired people faced particular social and educational challenges as well as cultural stereotyping as poor, pitiable and intellectually impaired. However, the experience of blind people also came to challenge received ideas that the visual was the privileged mode of accessing information about the world, and contributed to an increasingly complex understanding of the tactile sense.</p>

                     <p>A central tenet of critical medical humanities is the claim that biomedicine does not hold all the keys to understanding the experience of illness, how responses to treatment are mediated, or how it outcomes and prognosis are revealed over time. We further suggest that biomedicine cannot wholly explain how illness may be expressed physiologically. So much that influences that expression derives from cultural context, emotional response, and how illness is interpreted and understood that this knowledge cannot be exhausted with the tools of biomedicine.</p>

                     <p>The notion that the body can be changed at will in order to meet the desires and designs of its ‘owner’ is one that has captured the popular imagination and underpins contemporary medical practices such as cosmetic surgery and gender reassignment. In fact, describing the body as ‘malleable’ or ‘plastic’ has entered common parlance and dictates common-sense ideas of how we understand the human body in late-capitalist consumer societies in the wake of commercial biotechnologies that work to modify the body aesthetically and otherwise.

How do we come to know the body through the senses? And what does it mean to be a body and to encounter the body of the Other? Such questions resonate across the divide between the domains of philosophical and critical thought and clinical medicine, as likely to be asked by a doctor as by a humanities scholar. Yet the answers either might give would be spoken in radically different locations, utilise separate</p>

                     <p>It will be the argument of this chapter that, among the critiques that could be thought to contribute to a critical medical humanities, at least one may turn out to bear upon an important – but generally tacit – presumption in mainstream medical humanities. The presumption in question is that, taking our materiality and embodiment for granted, medical humanities’ principal task is to return the patient’s voice to prominence within the clinical encounter. The particular critique I have in mind involves disputing this very taken-for-granted-ness of our embodiment, and cautioning against replacing medicine’s neglect of the personal with medical humanities’ neglect of</p>

                     <p>Science (from the Latin,<italic>scientia</italic>) originally meant knowledge, so that ‘natural science’ meant knowledge of the natural world and of its laws. The term has since come to mean empirical, experimentally acquired knowledge and, as such, refers to some of the most powerful tools we have for understanding the world and indeed our own physiology. Scientific medicine has led to huge improvements in outcomes from a variety of conditions, from infectious diseases to cancer and heart disease. These advances have come, largely, from a mechanistic or reductionist approach to illness, which focuses on putting the body, understood as a physical</p>

                     <p>A properly critical medical humanities is also a historically grounded medical humanities. Such historical grounding requires taking a long cultural perspective, going beyond traditional medical history – typically the history of disease, treatment and practice – to trace the origins and development of the ideas that underpin medicine in its broadest sense – ideas concerning the most fundamental aspects of human existence: health and illness, body and mind, gender and family, care and community.¹ Historical sources can only go so far in illuminating such topics; we must also look to other cultural texts, and in particular literary texts, which, through their imaginative worlds,</p>

                     <p>In the late 1940s, the physician Théophile Alajouanine wrote an essay about a ‘rare group’ of people who had been left with the condition of aphasia following strokes or other cerebral ‘accidents’. Rare because they had all been professional artists prior to their illness, these patients were particularly useful to their doctor because they offered the intriguing possibility of studying the effect of aphasia – the loss or disturbance of the ability to use language intentionally – on aesthetic representation. The literary author Alajouanine treated was later revealed to be Valéry Larbaud, whose right-sided hemiplegia and aphasia had left him at first</p>

However, by the twenty-first century, recruitment of doctors from Africa was being compared with the slave trade in terms of its exploitative and damaging effects: ‘current policies of recruiting doctors from poor countries are a real cause of premature death and untreated disease in those countries and actively contribute to the sum of human misery.’² The assertion that employing foreign doctors was causing poor health in those doctors’ countries of origin was echoed in two reports</p>

                     <p>Francis Bacon is famous today as one of the founding fathers of the so-called ‘scientific revolution’ of the seventeenth century. Although not an especially successful scientist himself, he was nevertheless the most eloquent and influential spokesperson for an approach to knowledge that promised to transform human understanding of both humanity and its relationship with the natural and social worlds.¹ The central features of this approach, as they emerged in Bacon’s own writings and the work of his protégés and associates after 1605, are equally well known. They include the importance of experiment, observation, and a sceptical attitude towards inherited wisdom</p>

                     <p>For the last few decades cultural competence has been celebrated as the curricular response to a variety of political and social challenges in healthcare. These challenges include the persistence of race-and ethnicity-based health disparities, breakdowns in communication between the patient and provider, and issues of cultural difference around delivery and acceptance of healthcare.² Commonly defined as ‘a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency or among professionals and enable that system, agency or those professions to work effectively in cross-cultural situations’, cultural competence is meant to engender increased sensitivity, humility and awareness with</p>

                     <p>Narrative became a concept of great versatility and fluidity in the second half of the twentieth century, configuring multi-dimensional understandings and meanings in healthcare. The literary and social theorist Martin Kreiswirth speaks of ‘a massive and unprecedented eruption of interest in narrative and in theorizing about narrative’ in the period,³ which resulted in stories and fragments of stories gaining significant conceptual traction in many discourses and practices. Not until narrative began to be credited with such as multi-disciplinary capacities were claims for a pluripotential role in medicine explicitly formulated.⁴</p>

                     <p>Broadmoor Hospital is a problem. Located on the edge of the village of Crowthorne, Berkshire, it is an enduring and intransigent edifice that bears witness to a knotted medical and human history. In the sediments of its 153-year-old frame lie wasted both the humanitarian psychiatric innovations and the cruel barbarities of a period of profound change in mental asylums. Both architecturally and culturally the site is, in some ways, marked: it is a melancholic monument to madness and its chequered past. While almost all other asylums in Britain are closed, Broadmoor Hospital remains. It is, of course, no longer an</p>

                     <p>Care as a concept is central to any engagement with health, ill-health and the practices that aim to prevent, mitigate or cure, and the term itself is mobilised in a variety of different ways and at a variety of different scales. The vibrancy of the medical humanities as a relatively new field of inquiry has principally derived from the elaboration of experiential accounts of differential and dynamic conditions of health. Given this particular emphasis, attention to care and caring practices has predominantly concerned the nuanced and complex relations of care at an interpersonal and proximate scale. However, in contemporary landscapes</p>

                     <p>‘Care’ is a shifting, plural word when used in the context of discussions of health. It suggests attention and compassion when articulated as a verb, but has overtures of regulation and control when used as a noun – to be ‘in care’ is usually not unproblematic. Two chapters in this section – those by Sarah Atkinson and Lucy Burke – speak specifically to the complexities of this idea. As Atkinson makes clear in a her chapter, care invokes questions of resource just as much as it outlines interpersonal relationships; it presents what she terms ‘dilemmas, paradoxes and challenges’ when conceived of as a</p>
